## 🛠️ Getting Started (Installation)

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

You need a local server environment to run PHP and MySQL.

  * [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) (Recommended for Windows/Linux/Mac)
  * OR [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) (For Windows)
  * A Code Editor (VS Code recommended)

### Step-by-Step Installation

1.  **Install XAMPP:** Download and install XAMPP. Start the **Apache** and **MySQL** modules from the XAMPP Control Panel.

2.  **Fork & Clone the Repository:**

      * Navigate to your XAMPP installation folder (usually `C:\xampp\htdocs`).
      * Open your terminal/git bash in the `htdocs` folder.
      * Clone the repo:

    ```
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/jan_suraksha.git]
    ```

3.  **Database Configuration:**

      * Open your browser and go to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`.
      * Create a new database named **`jan_suraksha`** (Make sure this name matches your code).
      * Click on the **Import** tab.
      * Choose the **`schema.sql`** file provided in this repository and click **Go**.

4.  **Connect Database:**

      * Go to the project folder -> Open the `config.php` file.
      * Ensure the credentials match your local setup (Default XAMPP user is `root` with no password).

    ```
    $db_host = 'localhost';
    $db_user = 'root';
    $db_pass = ''; 
    $db_name = 'jan_suraksha';
    ```

5.  **Run the Project:**

      * Open your browser.
      * Go to: `http://localhost/jan_suraksha/jan_suraksha`


## Additional Notes (using Docker):

In case you're you want to use docker to run mysql instance.

```shell
    docker-compose up db -d
```

## Update values in the `config.php` file.

```shell
    $db_host = '127.0.0.1';
    $db_user = 'root';
    $db_pass = 'root';
    $db_name = 'jan_suraksha';
```
